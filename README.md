# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to gauge how many employees will be lost soon due to retirement. More specifically, which titles will need to be replaced as a result. To add, a new mentorship program is arising, and requirements for eligibility are included in the analysis as well.

## Results
- Of the 300,024 total employees for PH, 90,398 are expected to retire soon. That is just over 30% of their labor force needing to be replaced.
- Of the 90,398 employees anticipating retirement, 57,668 of them are either senior staff or senior engineers, meaning roughly 64% of positions needing to be filled will be senior positions.
- 50.2% (45,397) of the anticipated retirees are engineers, so about half of jobs needing to be filled will be engineering positions.
- There are 1,549 employees eligible for the mentorship program.

## Summary
- 90,398 roles will need to be filled come the 'silver tsunami'.

- Given the fact that there are more retirees per title than mentorees (provided in the tables below), there should be more than enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in each department to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees.
